# Tic-Tac-Toe
Weclome to my final project for CMSC150; I created a Tic Tac Toe game. 

Run the game file to begain playing against a computer AI

I made this game by creating a board class with an attribute for each "square" of the board, as well as the scanner package and random package. The player goes first by inputting which square they'd like make their move on. Then the computer goes by randomly picking a square. However, it checks beforehand for gaps that can win itself the game, or block the player from winning. 
Before each turn the game checks for a win, loss, or draw.
