# Tic-Tac-Toe
Weclome to my final project for CMSC150; I created a Tic Tac Toe game. 

Run the game file to begain playing against a computer AI

I made this game by creating a board class with an attribute for each "square" of the board. The player goes first and can pick which square they go in. Then the computer goes by randomly picking a square. However, it checks beforehand for gaps that can win itself the game, or block the player from winning. 
Before each turn the game checks for a win, loss, or draw.
